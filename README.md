<h3 align="center">About VinHack</h3>

<strong><p align="justify">VinHack was a hackathon ogranized by VinnovateIT at VIT Vellore. The organizing team was led by Shreya Anand, President of VinnovateIT. I had honour of being a member of judge panel. That was great experience for me. My contribution includes :
  
  <ul>
  <li>Monitoring the development of website</li>
  <li>Developed go to place for the participants</li>
  <li>Created quiz contest for the participants</li>
  <li>Made problem statements</li>
  </ul>
</p></strong>

This is basic timer which I've made for VinHack. It shows the notifications for the commits made on VinnovateIT GitHub Organization. This helps in boosting the energy of participants. If you're organizing a hackathon, you can use this! Just change the the url below with your organization's `url` and here you go!
